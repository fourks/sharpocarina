SharpOcarina is a scene development tool for _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_ (and possibly _Majora's Mask_) for the Nintendo 64.

Written in C# and using OpenTK for the scene preview, the program allows the user to create new levels by importing Wavefront .obj models, adding game-specific level components (actors, waterboxes, etc.) and customizing the rendering of the models in-game (ex. translucency), then automatically converting all the data into the game's or resp. the system's native formats.

# Note: Active development ceased #
